Aero Sim is a dynamic plugin designed for managing game atmospheres, offering extensive customization options for gas concentrations, temperature, humidity, pressure and gravity.

By incorporating vents (which support 27 distinct gases), heaters, coolers, gas vents, steam vents, and condensers, you can craft a wide range of atmospheric environments, alongside various other customizable settings, in your games.
