# FAQ

**What is Aero Sim?**

- Aero Sim is a plugin designed for managing atmospheric conditions in virtual environments. It offers customizable settings for gas concentrations, temperature, humidity, and visual effects, enhancing the realism and dynamics of your game world.

**Can Aero Sim simulate real-world atmospheric conditions?**

- While Aero Sim provides detailed atmospheric control, it is optimized for game development rather than simulating exact real-world conditions. It offers a balance between realism and computational efficiency, making it ideal for creating believable yet manageable virtual environments.

**How does Aero Sim handle different gases?**

- Aero Sim allows you to manage a variety of gases through its **Gases** property. You can set base concentrations and cap concentrations for different gas types, tailoring the atmospheric composition to your specific requirements.

**Can I control the influence radius of atmospheric effects?**

- Yes, Aero Sim lets you set an **Influence Radius** to define the area within which atmospheric changes are effective. This can be overridden to always influence the atmosphere, regardless of distance, using the **bInfluenceUnbound** property.

**Is Aero Sim suitable for simulating extreme weather conditions?**

- Aero Sim is flexible enough to handle a range of atmospheric scenarios, including extreme weather conditions. By adjusting temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations, you can create diverse environmental conditions.

**Does Aero Sim include humidity control?**

- Yes, Aero Sim includes a humidity control feature. You can set the average humidity level and define how it influences gas concentrations in your virtual environment.

**How does temperature management work in Aero Sim?**

- Aero Sim allows you to set an average temperature and a maximum temperature cap, which influence the overall thermal characteristics of your environment. These settings are crucial for simulating different climatic conditions. Additionally, you can activate the **bUseAdvancedInfluence** option, which allows factors such as temperature, humidity, and gravity to influence your gas concentrations.
