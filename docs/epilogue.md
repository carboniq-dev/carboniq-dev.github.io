# Epilogue

Kindly take note that although the plugin holds the capacity to serve a multitude of purposes, it is not intended to serve as a conclusive game solution. Rather, it is crafted to equip developers with a robust toolset to craft the final solution.

While the objective was to streamline the snapping process while offering maximum flexibility, some behaviors may not appear self-explanatory. If you believe that the documentation does not adequately cover the use cases and settings, please do not hesitate to contact me via the Epic Store.

Thank you for taking an interest in **Snap Central**. I hope you find it both useful and enjoyable!
