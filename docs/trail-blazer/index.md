# Introduction

TrailBlazer is a specialized **grid-based pathfinding plugin** tailored for Unreal Engine projects requiring precise and customizable navigation solutions. Ideal for puzzle games, mazes, and small to medium-sized game environments, this plugin provides an alternative to Unreal Engine's built-in pathfinding, focusing on specific scenarios where grid-based navigation is preferred. While it offers capabilities for larger landscapes, its optimal performance is seen in more contained environments. The plugin includes various adjustable settings like grid size, cell dimensions, and **heuristic methods**, giving developers the flexibility to fine-tune navigation to suit their game's unique requirements.

!!! Info
    This plugin is not intended to replace Unreal Engine's built-in pathfinding tools. It is tailored for developers who require complete control over all path locations and intricate navigation scenarios.
