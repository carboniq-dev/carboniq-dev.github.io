# Introduction

TrailBlazer is a dedicated plugin crafted for {==grid-based==} pathfinding, offering a valuable option for projects requiring accurate and adaptable navigation solutions. While its primary strength lies in {==2D grid-based pathfinding==}, it also offers an option to consider landscape height along the z-axis. This plugin is particularly well-suited for puzzle games, mazes, and game environments of small to medium size.

TrailBlazer is focused on specific scenarios where grid-based navigation is the preferred approach. While it does provide capabilities for larger landscapes, it performs optimally in more contained environments. You can take advantage of various adjustable settings such as grid size, cell dimensions, obstacle detection options and heuristic methods to fine-tune navigation and tailor it to the unique requirements of your game.

!!! Info
    This {==grid-based==} plugin is {==not==} intended to replace Unreal Engine's built-in pathfinding tools. It is tailored for developers who require complete control over all path locations and intricate navigation scenarios within a grid-based environment. It is not ideally suited for highly complex landscapes and environments.
