# Introduction

Offering customizable solutions for specific pathfinding needs, this plugin excels in dynamically handling obstacles and uses the A* algorithm for asynchronous, grid-based pathfinding. It's particularly suited for smaller maps or designated areas and can handle multiple pathfinding grids simultaneously, making it perfect for workload distribution across larger maps.

!!! Info
    This plugin is not intended to replace Unreal Engine's built-in pathfinding tools. It is tailored for developers who require complete control over all path locations and intricate navigation scenarios.
