# Epilogue

The **Trail Blazer** pathfinding plugin is a versatile and powerful tool, thoughtfully crafted to provide developers with a customizable and alternative pathfinding solution, especially in scenarios requiring grid-based navigation. While it's not designed to replace Unreal Engine's native pathfinding solutions, it excels in particular use cases such as puzzles, mazes, and situations where fine-grained control over the pathfinding process and environment is essential.

TrailBlazer's flexibility extends to adapting it for larger landscapes, although it's important to keep performance and scalability considerations in mind when doing so.

Thank you for showing interest in **Trail Blazer**. I hope it proves to be a valuable tool for you.
