# Epilogue

In closing, **Trail Blazer** is a solution for customizable pathfinding in grid-based scenarios. Its true potential shines in applications like puzzles, mazes, and situations where you need precise control over your pathfinding. While it doesn't aim to replace Unreal Engine's native pathfinding tools, it offers a versatile alternative for specific games. Keep in mind that, with some consideration, Trail Blazer can also adapt to larger landscapes, although you should always keep an eye on performance and scalability.

Thank you for considering Trail Blazer, and I hope it becomes a valuable asset in your project's toolbox.
